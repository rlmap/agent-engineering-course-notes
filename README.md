# Agent Engineering Course Notes

An archive of notes from the [Agent Engineering course](https://maven.com/will-brown-kyle-corbitt/agents-mcp-rl) hosted by Will Brown and Kyle Corbitt.

## Course Goals

Q: *What are your goals for the course? What brought you here? What challenges are you working on?*
> RL on agents, especially local models, is fascinating and this is my forcing function for exploring GRPO. Prime Intellect has the mandate of heaven. Labeling everyday data to be useful for agents.

- Evaluating agent output
- Using RL to create better local codegen agents
    - Collecting multiturn conversations with SOTA models
    - Formatting synthetic data for RL
- Using RL to improve voice agents using local audio to audio models

## Repo Goals

- Document and organize course notes and learnings
- Articulate and reframe questions for better understanding
- Summarize class discussions and community sentiment
- Highlight projects from community members
- Track progress and TODOs
