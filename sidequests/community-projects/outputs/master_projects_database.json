The core idea was to automate the selection of suitable recipes while ensuring they met specific criteria, particularly kid-friendliness and nutritional balance.\n\nApproaches Tried\n\nThe primary approach involved:\n\n1.  **Iterative API Calls:** For each day of the week, a Large Language Model (LLM) was prompted to select a meal category.\n    \n2.  **Custom JSON Extraction:** After the LLM provided a category, a custom JSON extraction method was used to parse the LLM's response.\n    \n3.  **Recipe API Integration:** The extracted category was then used to call an external recipe API (via call_tool(\"get_meal_from_category\", {\"category\": category})) to retrieve a meal.\n    \n4.  **Reward Function for Validation:** A custom reward_function was implemented to evaluate the suitability of the retrieved meal. This function assessed several factors:\n    \n    *   **Protein Content:** Checking for protein keywords in the meal name.\n        \n    *   **Dinner Appropriateness:** Ensuring the meal category was not \"dessert,\" \"side,\" \"starter,\" or \"breakfast.\"\n        \n    *   **Kid-Friendliness:** A check_kid_friendly function (though its implementation isn't fully detailed here, it's crucial for the overall goal) was used to rate the meal's appeal to children, likely by analyzing ingredients and general meal type.\n        \n    *   **Main Course Classification:** Granting bonus points for typical main course categories (e.g., beef, chicken, pasta).\n        \n    *   **Dinner-Appropriate Terms:** Looking for terms like \"roast,\" \"grilled,\" or \"stew\" in the meal name.\n        \n5.  **Retry Mechanism:** A get_validated_meal function was implemented with a retry logic. If a selected meal did not meet the validation criteria (score below 60), the LLM was prompted again with feedback, guiding it to select a more appropriate category.\n    \n\nRoadblocks Encountered\n\nThe biggest challenge encountered was **selecting the recipe itself** from the list returned by the API. Initially, the approach involved:\n\n*   **Random Selection:** The API returns a list of recipes, and a random choice was made. This often led to sub-optimal selections that didn't meet the \"kid-friendly\" or \"nutritionally balanced\" criteria.\n    \n*   **LLM-Driven Recipe Selection (Complication):** An attempt was made to pass the list of recipes to an LLM along with an exclusion list to find the best option. This approach proved to be **overly complicated** to implement and manage effectively within the existing framework. The complexity of having the LLM reason over multiple options and an exclusion list, while adhering to the desired output format, became a significant hurdle.\n    \n\nAnother notable roadblock was the **tool-calling aspect**. Rather than allowing the AI to fully drive the tool calling for each day's meal selection, a **loop for each day** was implemented. This suggests that achieving a fully autonomous, AI-driven tool calling process for the entire sequence was either not feasible with the chosen LLM or became too complex to control reliably within the project's scope.\n\n**Evaluation Methods**\n\nThe primary evaluation method was a **custom scoring function** embedded within the reward_function. This function calculated an \"overall satisfaction score\" for each recipe based on:\n\n*   **Standard parsing of text for proteins and ingredients:** This likely involved keyword matching for protein sources and potentially analyzing ingredient lists for elements that might make a meal less kid-friendly (e.g., spicy ingredients).\n    \n*   **Categorization checks:** Ensuring the meal fit appropriate dinner categories.\n    \n*   **Kid-friendliness rating:** A crucial component, which provided a specific score and reason based on whether the meal was \"Very Kid-Friendly,\" \"Somewhat Kid-Friendly,\" or \"Not Kid-Friendly.\"\n    \n\nThe reward_function returned a boolean is_valid flag and a numerical score, along with detailed feedback for each meal. This feedback was instrumental in guiding the retry mechanism and understanding why certain meals were rejected. The final evaluation summarized the total_score and average score for the entire 7-day plan, providing a quantitative measure of the plan's overall quality.\n\n**Smallest Model That Worked Decently Well**\n\nThe model that successfully achieved decent results was meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.

      "project_html": "<p><strong>Code:</strong> <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/blankwall/db6ca413069093803b16404552eeef53\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://gist.github.com/blankwall/db6ca413069093803b16404552eeef53</a><br/>\n<br/>\nThis project details the development and experimentation of a system designed to generate a 7-day kid-friendly meal plan by interacting with a recipe API. The core idea was to automate the selection of suitable recipes while ensuring they met specific criteria, particularly kid-friendliness and nutritional balance.<br/>\n<br/>\nApproaches Tried<br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary approach involved:<br/>\n<br/>\n1.  <strong>Iterative API Calls:</strong> For each day of the week, a Large Language Model (LLM) was prompted to select a meal category.<br/>\n    <br/>\n2.  <strong>Custom JSON Extraction:</strong> After the LLM provided a category, a custom JSON extraction method was used to parse the LLM’s response.<br/>\n    <br/>\n3.  <strong>Recipe API Integration:</strong> The extracted category was then used to call an external recipe API (via call_tool(“get_meal_from_category”, {“category”: category})) to retrieve a meal.<br/>\n    <br/>\n4.  <strong>Reward Function for Validation:</strong> A custom reward_function was implemented to evaluate the suitability of the retrieved meal. This function assessed several factors:<br/>\n    <br/>\n    *   <strong>Protein Content:</strong> Checking for protein keywords in the meal name.<br/>\n        <br/>\n    *   <strong>Dinner Appropriateness:</strong> Ensuring the meal category was not “dessert,” “side,” “starter,” or “breakfast.”<br/>\n        <br/>\n    *   <strong>Kid-Friendliness:</strong> A check_kid_friendly function (though its implementation isn’t fully detailed here, it’s crucial for the overall goal) was used to rate the meal’s appeal to children, likely by analyzing ingredients and general meal type.<br/>\n        <br/>\n    *   <strong>Main Course Classification:</strong> Granting bonus points for typical main course categories (e.g., beef, chicken, pasta).<br/>\n        <br/>\n    *   <strong>Dinner-Appropriate Terms:</strong> Looking for terms like “roast,” “grilled,” or “stew” in the meal name.<br/>\n        <br/>\n5.  <strong>Retry Mechanism:</strong> A get_validated_meal function was implemented with a retry logic. If a selected meal did not meet the validation criteria (score below 60), the LLM was prompted again with feedback, guiding it to select a more appropriate category.<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\nRoadblocks Encountered<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest challenge encountered was <strong>selecting the recipe itself</strong> from the list returned by the API. Initially, the approach involved:<br/>\n<br/>\n*   <strong>Random Selection:</strong> The API returns a list of recipes, and a random choice was made. This often led to sub-optimal selections that didn’t meet the “kid-friendly” or “nutritionally balanced” criteria.<br/>\n    <br/>\n*   <strong>LLM-Driven Recipe Selection (Complication):</strong> An attempt was made to pass the list of recipes to an LLM along with an exclusion list to find the best option. This approach proved to be <strong>overly complicated</strong> to implement and manage effectively within the existing framework. The complexity of having the LLM reason over multiple options and an exclusion list, while adhering to the desired output format, became a significant hurdle.<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\nAnother notable roadblock was the <strong>tool-calling aspect</strong>. Rather than allowing the AI to fully drive the tool calling for each day’s meal selection, a <strong>loop for each day</strong> was implemented. This suggests that achieving a fully autonomous, AI-driven tool calling process for the entire sequence was either not feasible with the chosen LLM or became too complex to control reliably within the project’s scope.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Evaluation Methods</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThe primary evaluation method was a <strong>custom scoring function</strong> embedded within the reward_function. This function calculated an “overall satisfaction score” for each recipe based on:<br/>\n<br/>\n*   <strong>Standard parsing of text for proteins and ingredients:</strong> This likely involved keyword matching for protein sources and potentially analyzing ingredient lists for elements that might make a meal less kid-friendly (e.g., spicy ingredients).<br/>\n    <br/>\n*   <strong>Categorization checks:</strong> Ensuring the meal fit appropriate dinner categories.<br/>\n    <br/>\n*   <strong>Kid-friendliness rating:</strong> A crucial component, which provided a specific score and reason based on whether the meal was “Very Kid-Friendly,” “Somewhat Kid-Friendly,” or “Not Kid-Friendly.”<br/>\n    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reward_function returned a boolean is_valid flag and a numerical score, along with detailed feedback for each meal. This feedback was instrumental in guiding the retry mechanism and understanding why certain meals were rejected. The final evaluation summarized the total_score and average score for the entire 7-day plan, providing a quantitative measure of the plan’s overall quality.<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Smallest Model That Worked Decently Well</strong><br/>\n<br/>\nThe model that successfully achieved decent results was meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. While other models like deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-14B. were considered or experimented with, proved to be effective enough for this task. The current code uses meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct. The key was likely the robust prompt engineering and the iterative feedback loop, which compensated for the model’s size.</p>\n",

I wrote up my own tools and ran into a myriad of issues getting them to play well with the agent.<br/>\n        <br/>\n        *   Fun fact: I had to write a custom reward function to override how pylint scores the code because apparently it doesn’t like one-liners and scores them 0/10.<br/>\n            <br/>\n    *   It was an interesting experience debugging the debugger tool, figuring out how to run code in a decently safe way for testing, not blow over the context by carefully filtering the execution system traces, etc.<br/>\n        <br/>\n    *   I built a tool registry with some helper methods including for discovery of tools and generating dynamic tool descriptions from their docstrings.<br/>\n        <br/>\n*   Prompting<br/>\n    <br/>\n    *   Keeping the system and user prompts to the point with explicit instructions and dynamically injecting the tool/problem context worked well. Probably could do more experimentation in the future as the task complexity increases.<br/>\n        <br/>\n*   Models<br/>\n    <br/>\n    *   Used LiteLLM as the main interface to keep open the possibility for testing many models easily.<br/>\n        <br/>\n    *   Ran tests using the GPT-4.1 series (nano, mini, large). The nano model was great for fast turnaround during debugging sessions.<br/>\n        <br/>\n*   Rewards<br/>\n    <br/>\n    *   Added 3 tiers of rewards<br/>\n        <br/>\n        *   Primary Deterministic Rewards (success rate, completion rate, efficiency score)<br/>\n            <br/>\n        *   Secondary Objective Rewards (invalid action penalty, regression penalty, linter score)<br/>\n            <br/>\n        *   Tertiary Subjective (aka LLM-as-judge) Rewards (code elegance score, strategic efficiency score)<br/>\n            <br/>\n    *   Didn’t get around to playing with the calibration on these much, but there’s plenty of room to tweak things here.<br/>\n        <br/>\n*   Evals<br/>\n    <br/>\n    *   Compared the selected model set on my tiny example dataset and unsurprisingly they all got every question correct. There are some differences in efficiency between the models as expected, but this needs a much larger dataset to glean any insights and potentially more realistic examples.<br/>\n        <br/>\n    *   I’ve implemented best-of-N sampling but need a more challenging dataset to make the most of it.<br/>\n        <br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\nI’d appreciate any comments, feedback, contributions or issues!</p>\n",

      "project_text": "**Report on Making a LessWrong Search Agent**\n\nGoal: Make a conversational agent with search tools over a downloaded repository of all LessWrong.\n\nIdeally, it should be able to accurately answer simple, very fact-based questions (\"What's the most popular post on LessWrong?\", \"What kind of things does user X like to talk about?\") but also more vague, subjective questions (\"How has Yudkowsky's emotional state changed for the worse over time?\")\n\nI'll divide the report into three sections: (1) problems I ran into spinning up the agent initially, before putting together the test questions, (2) performance and problems when testing on my first set of golden answers, and (3) performance and problems after revising the agent scaffolding in light of the problems encountered in section 2.\n\n**1\\. Initial Work**\n\nFor the chat engine, I'm using the basic ReAct pattern inside XML tags. The system prompt asks for text to all be in , , or tags. Not using any inference forcing; just returning an error to the LLM in case it doesn't return within this criteria.\n\nI started off with 4 LessWrong specific tools:\n\n*   A search tool over usernames, returning user names, average karma, most recent posts, etc.\n*   A search tool over posts, that lets you filter by user name and date, while returning post title, post id, etc.\n*   A tool that returns the first N characters for some post id.\n*   A tool that let's you query another LLM instance, to summarize some post or return specific points about it.\n\nInitial notes:\n\n*   Used DeepSeekV3-0528 for the base LLM.\n*   I had to adjust the system prompt to prevent hallucinated tool responses. I'd see the model try to do a tool-call inside , then hallucinate a response to the tool-call immediately afterwards. Pretty persistent across models without some edits.\n*   Found tests pretty important for tools, decided (after spinning up very buggy working version) to ofc write those first, to pretend that I wasn't a moron.\n*   LLMs seem lazy, or apt to do the minimum number of tool calls. At first, it was very inclined to just have _ONE_ tool use. After I changed the prompt to explicitly indicate multiple tool uses are allowed and encouraged, it would then do multiple calls. But if, for instance, you ask for a summary of what some dude on LW tends to write about, it still seems to prefer to do a search for a bunch of post titles, and then just summarize this content while inferring the content from the titles. Or, if you ask for what some author X has written about topic Y, it looks at the top 5 posts by that person and just summarizes from whichever of the top posts is MOST relevant to Y without bothering to search for more. I've fiddled with the system prompt but this seems like a recurring theme.\n*   I've added, to the tool descriptions for the LLMs, hints about when to use the tools. This has helped stop some dumb problems.\n*   tried using RegEx or string similarity functions for my evaluation questions. However, I quickly decided that for most questions these sucked. So I quickly switched to exclusively using LLM-as-a-judge, with an \"expected\" golden answer compared to the answer that the LLM returned.\n\n**2\\. Tests on 9 questions.**\n\nI put together 9 reasonably high quality questions with a LLM judge, that compares to a golden answer and then gives a score of correct or not. Here are the basic results on a variety of increasingly\n\n\\- DeepseekV3-0528: 8/9\n\n\\- Qwen_285: 5/9\n\n\\- Qwen_30b: 5/9\n\n\\- Llama3.3 70b: 2/9\n\nNotes on reading through the chain-of-thought for all these questions (see backend/test_results for the chain-of-thought / tool use invocations from each model).\n\n*   On long chains of thought requiring multiple tool uses, many LLMs seem apt to forget the format -- i.e., they will put their final response outside of a tag, in just plaintext after the tag. I've also noticed this in conversations through my UI. Even the smartest models seem apt to have this problem after long-enough of a problem. Probably just because the tag is standard but is not.\n*   There's a little bit of a problem with the LLMs like Qwen simply one-shotting LessWrong usernames from memory. Or, it's not exactly a problem, but it does make me distrust how good my tools and test would generalize to less common LessWrong usernames or cases.\n*   Curiously, Qwen also hallucinated errors from the tools.\n*   Llama3.3 70b has much more difficulty inferring whether particular tool calls should have integer or string arguments. I was irritated at Llama initially, but looking through my system prompt, I did note that I didn't have an example of tool calls involving integer values. So, mostly on me.\n\n**3\\. Changes in response to errors and results afterwards**\n\nChanges:\n\n*   Add example tool calls to the system prompt for each tool. In cases of complex tools, I include both a minimalistic prompt (only using mandated arguments) and a maximalistic prompt (using the maximum number of arguments possible) among the examples.\n*   Improving error messages returned to the LLM, so that if you tried to return text outside of XML tags OR if you tried using multiple XML tags of one type, the LLM gets a more informative LLM response in return. This is important, because rather than using inference formatting I am just letting the LLM work unconstrained.\n*   Dropping one tool -- the one that let you read the first N characters of a LessWong post -- in favor of exclusively permitting the use of a tool that allowed you to request another LLM for a summary. In general the post content-returning tool just sucked; LessWrong posts can be very long, and the first N characters often don't tell you that much.\n*   Increasing the maximum number of tool-calls from 10 to 32.\n*   Adding a final sentence to the system prompt that tells the LLM: \"When answering, think carefully about the meaning of the question. Feel free to think for a while, or use as many tool calls as you need to get the best answer.\"\n\n  \n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\- DeepseekV3-0528: 8/9 (?!)\n\n\\- Qwen3 30b: 7/9\n\n\\- Qwen3 235b: 7/9\n\n\\- Llama3.3 70b: 5/4\n\nExact numbers depend on luck, but if you repeat a few times you usually get numbers about like this.\n\nLooking through the results:\n\n*   I take back what I said about Llama 3.3 70b calling in the wrong format being my fault. Even when provided with explicit examples of the right format it wants to call in the wrong way. It's just stupid.\n*   In general, glancing at several runs, the LLMs struggle with queries that require you to recognize when some criteria has NOT been met. For instance, one of my questions asks for the most popular post by Paul F Christiano that is NOT a response to some other post. The most popular post by Christano, however, \"Where I agree and disagree with Elizer,\" and is a response to Yudkowsky. Every LLM had problems consistently noticing this; many read the title and said something like \"Well, it's not explicitly Re: What You Said,\" and rather than checking the post text decided to just give that as a response.\n*   Similarly, one of my questions asks for an imaginary concept -- \"Montaigne-influenced rationality\" -- and expects the LLM to respond be saying \"I couldn't find it.\" But LLMs prefer to confabulate probable answers (\"Well, Yudkowksy talks about rationality a lot, so he probably talked about this\") or just mention anyone who mentioned Montaigne. Again, they struggle a great deal with the negative; knowing when some query has NOT returned something which meets their goals.\n\n  \n\nLooking back, at things I should have spent much more time on from the start:\n\n*   My auto-judge sometimes returns tendentious yes or nos. In general, spending more time on my auto-judge would have probably been a good use of time.\n*   Probably more time making the conversation logic shorter and easier to understand would have paid over with a speedier testing cycle.\n*   Maybe larger number of simpler questions would have been better than the more advanced questions that I looked to evaluate at first.\n\n  \n\nBut in the end, the bot does work, and my UI does work. I'm reasonably happy that I can ask a question like this:\n\n\\> Could you try to summarize how Yudkowsky's style of posts have changed over time on LessWrong? Specifically, focus on how he's trying to evoke specific emotions in the reader, and how his relation to the reader and what he wants to do for them changes -- how does he see his relation to the reader? What kind of a follower does he want? Try to read at leas like, 4 early posts and 4 later posts.\n\n  \n\nAnd get an answer including this:\n\n  \n\n\\> Key Shifts:\n\n\\> 1. From Teaching to Warning: Early posts focus on training rationalists; later posts scream alarms about existential risks.\n\n\\> 2. From Community-Building to Polarization: \"Preface\" praises collective progress, but \"AGI Ruin\" dismisses mainstream efforts as suicidal.\n\n\\> 3. From Optimism to Fatalism: Early work assumes rationality can fix human flaws; later work implies most are doomed unless they meet his epistemic standards.",

Every LLM had problems consistently noticing this; many read the title and said something like “Well, it’s not explicitly Re: What You Said,” and rather than checking the post text decided to just give that as a response.<br/>\n*   Similarly, one of my questions asks for an imaginary concept – “Montaigne-influenced rationality” – and expects the LLM to respond be saying “I couldn’t find it.” But LLMs prefer to confabulate probable answers (“Well, Yudkowksy talks about rationality a lot, so he probably talked about this”) or just mention anyone who mentioned Montaigne. Again, they struggle a great deal with the negative; knowing when some query has NOT returned something which meets their goals.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nLooking back, at things I should have spent much more time on from the start:<br/>\n<br/>\n*   My auto-judge sometimes returns tendentious yes or nos. In general, spending more time on my auto-judge would have probably been a good use of time.<br/>\n*   Probably more time making the conversation logic shorter and easier to understand would have paid over with a speedier testing cycle.<br/>\n*   Maybe larger number of simpler questions would have been better than the more advanced questions that I looked to evaluate at first.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut in the end, the bot does work, and my UI does work. I’m reasonably happy that I can ask a question like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Could you try to summarize how Yudkowsky’s style of posts have changed over time on LessWrong? Specifically, focus on how he’s trying to evoke specific emotions in the reader, and how his relation to the reader and what he wants to do for them changes – how does he see his relation to the reader? What kind of a follower does he want? Try to read at leas like, 4 early posts and 4 later posts.<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd get an answer including this:<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; Key Shifts:<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 1. From Teaching to Warning: Early posts focus on training rationalists; later posts scream alarms about existential risks.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 2. From Community-Building to Polarization: “Preface” praises collective progress, but “AGI Ruin” dismisses mainstream efforts as suicidal.<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt; 3. From Optimism to Fatalism: Early work assumes rationality can fix human flaws; later work implies most are doomed unless they meet his epistemic standards.</p>\n",

There is a good amount of variance per run so a proper test should have multiple runs per grouping (I haven't done that due to time and $$ for now).\n\nFor more context check the images shared!\n\n  \n\n**✅ Interesting findings**\n\n\\- Stronger models as orchestrators are quite essential for good use of the sub-agents. Stronger models for the sub-agents might not be as essential and/or have not as strong compartive gains (very sensible due to limitations on my dataset).\n\n\\- Stronger models are more aggressive in terms of tool calls\n\n\\- Parallel tool calling seems to be something used by a wide range of models and it reallys speeds up the inference time\n\n  \n\n**🚧 Identified Limitations**\n\n\\- Models allucinate a lot on contact information on the lack more details (example: there is a mention of the name on a article but not contact info is shared. The model will then come up with fake info for the contact once it knows the person exists)\n\n\\- The search paths are very narrow and and can totally get out of correct path when faced with some timeout or other types of page retrieval errors.\n\n\\- There is an important need to have a fact check phase. The model tends to ignore important filtering cases like WHERE and CONTEXT clausese. This normally happens when models expand search and then the filters get \"lost\" in their context or attention\n\n  \n\n**Planned Improvements**\n\n\\- **Enhanced Fact-Checking**: Stronger validation pipeline to prevent filter drift after first submission of leads\n\n\\- **Broader Search Exploration**: Multiple parallel research paths with fallback strategies\n\n\\- **Semantic Lead Comparison**: Embedding-based similarity instead of string matching\n\n\\- **Real-time Lead Scoring**: Dynamic quality assessment and prioritization\n\n\\- **Individual Field Evaluation**: Granular accuracy metrics for each contact field",

Automated Evaluation</strong> (`eval_runner.py`):<br/>\n<br/>\n- DeepEval integration with custom GEval metrics<br/>\n<br/>\n- LLM-based correctness scoring<br/>\n<br/>\n- Recall and precision tracking<br/>\n<br/>\n- Visual lead comparison before evaluation<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>3. Rich Visual Comparison</strong> (`utils/lead_comparison.py`):<br/>\n<br/>\n- Field-by-field lead comparison with color coding<br/>\n<br/>\n- Match detection based on name/email similarity<br/>\n<br/>\n- Missing/extra lead identification<br/>\n<br/>\n- Comprehensive summary statistics with recall calculations<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Results &amp; Performance Analysis</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\nSystematic evaluation across multiple LLM models:<br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>OpenAI</strong>: GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, GPT-4.1-nano<br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>Anthropic</strong>: Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Sonnet<br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Evaluation Metrics</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>G-Eval Score</strong>: LLM-based correctness assessment<br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>Recall Rate</strong>: Percentage of expected leads successfully found<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Key Findings</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>Limitations of the analysis</strong>: only one run was done for each of the model combinatinations. There is a good amount of variance per run so a proper test should have multiple runs per grouping (I haven’t done that due to time and $$ for now).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor more context check the images shared!<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>✅ Interesting findings</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n- Stronger models as orchestrators are quite essential for good use of the sub-agents. Stronger models for the sub-agents might not be as essential and/or have not as strong compartive gains (very sensible due to limitations on my dataset).<br/>\n<br/>\n- Stronger models are more aggressive in terms of tool calls<br/>\n<br/>\n- Parallel tool calling seems to be something used by a wide range of models and it reallys speeds up the inference time<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>🚧 Identified Limitations</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n- Models allucinate a lot on contact information on the lack more details (example: there is a mention of the name on a article but not contact info is shared. The model will then come up with fake info for the contact once it knows the person exists)<br/>\n<br/>\n- The search paths are very narrow and and can totally get out of correct path when faced with some timeout or other types of page retrieval errors.<br/>\n<br/>\n- There is an important need to have a fact check phase. The model tends to ignore important filtering cases like WHERE and CONTEXT clausese. This normally happens when models expand search and then the filters get “lost” in their context or attention<br/>\n<br/>\n  <br/>\n<br/>\n<strong>Planned Improvements</strong><br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>Enhanced Fact-Checking</strong>: Stronger validation pipeline to prevent filter drift after first submission of leads<br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>Broader Search Exploration</strong>: Multiple parallel research paths with fallback strategies<br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>Semantic Lead Comparison</strong>: Embedding-based similarity instead of string matching<br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>Real-time Lead Scoring</strong>: Dynamic quality assessment and prioritization<br/>\n<br/>\n- <strong>Individual Field Evaluation</strong>: Granular accuracy metrics for each contact field</p>\n",

      "project_text": "My goal is to build a model provider agnostic (multi-)agent chat interface where the user can perform data analysis based on input files, other input data sources like document based RAG using a code_interpreter tool to generate and execute python scripts and finally present the results acquired together with the agent in a powerpoint presentation.  \n  \nI started with an OpenAI Assistants API based solution where the OpenAI internal code_interpreter solution is ready to be used. I built a python-pptx based tool to create powerpoint presentations using a fixed master slide and the content from the LLM. The OpenAI based solution is also a baseline for all further improvements.  \n  \nNext I started to look for a solution towards the model provider agnostic goal and looked into PydanticAI as a solution to standardizing the LLM communication. First I implemented a Wrapper for the Tools using PydanticAI and Pydantic classes defining the inputs and autogeneration in serializing the schema from the docstring. There I already ran into the problem of it not being Assistants API format compatible.

      "project_html": "<p>My goal is to build a model provider agnostic (multi-)agent chat interface where the user can perform data analysis based on input files, other input data sources like document based RAG using a code_interpreter tool to generate and execute python scripts and finally present the results acquired together with the agent in a powerpoint presentation.  <br/>\n  <br/>\nI started with an OpenAI Assistants API based solution where the OpenAI internal code_interpreter solution is ready to be used. I built a python-pptx based tool to create powerpoint presentations using a fixed master slide and the content from the LLM. The OpenAI based solution is also a baseline for all further improvements.  <br/>\n  <br/>\nNext I started to look for a solution towards the model provider agnostic goal and looked into PydanticAI as a solution to standardizing the LLM communication. First I implemented a Wrapper for the Tools using PydanticAI and Pydantic classes defining the inputs and autogeneration in serializing the schema from the docstring. There I already ran into the problem of it not being Assistants API format compatible.
